## Day11 - Execptional Handling
### Definition
*One of the effective means to **handle the runtime errors** so that the regular flow of the application can be preserved.*

- An exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program i.e at run time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions.
- Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object. It contains information about the exception such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the program when the exception occurred.
- Exceptional Handling

### Reasons
- Invalid user input
- Device failure
- Loss of network connection
- Physical limitations (out of disk memory)
- Code errors
- Opening an unavailable file

### Example
1. Read a file, however
  - File Not Fould
  - File Is Corrupted
2. Divide a/b, however denominator b=0, lead to Arithmetic issue. 

### Scala vs Java
Exception Handling in Java is very similar to Scala. But Java have two types exceptions: checked and unchecked exception; **Scala only has unchecked expression**. 
- <ins> Checked exception </ins>: Mandatory to check this kind of expression at compile time so they are also called compile time exceptions. E.g., File/Class Not Found. 
  - ClassNotFoundException
  - IOException
  - SQLException
- <ins> Unchecked exception </ins>: Not checked by the compiler, also called runtime exceptions. Exmaple: a program is ok to be compiled so checked exeption pass, but when run, it throws arithmetic error. Then, it's unchecked exception.
  - ArithmeticException
  - ArrayStoreException
  - ClassCastException

### When come across an exception, either we can make a throw or handle it.

- Throw exception - Pass the exception to the main/another program. 

- Handle - 3 ways to handle:
  1. Try...Catch... (traditional way)
  2. Try (with predifined Class)...Success/Failure...
  3. Catch object

## Day12 - Traits, Value Class & Universal Traits
### Definition
- Traits encapsulates methods and fields definition. 
- Trait is very similar to class, it's defined by key word - trait. 
- Cannot create the object intance for trait.
- It's only used for inheritance purpose.
- **In class, one child class cannot extends multiple parent classes. However, in trait, one child class can extends multiple traits.**

### Example 1
```
trait xyz {
      var x = 10
      def add() = {1 + 2}
      };
      
class xyz1 extends xyz   // create a child class xyz1 inherit the trait xyz, whatever available in trait will be available in xyz1. 
```

### Example 2
***Traits can have unimplemented methods, but unimplemented methods should be implemented in the class extending the given trait***
```
trait Car {
  def engine()= {println("1000cc")}
  def wheel()                             // wheel() here is unimlemented method
  def breaks()                            // breaks() here is unimlemented method
}

class mercedes extends Car{
  def engine()= {println("2000cc")}.       // overwrite the method in parent class if the method body was already present
  def wheel()= {print("wheels")}           // wheel() body must be implemented in the child class extends the trait
  def breaks()= {print("Disk brekas")}     // breaks() boydy must be implemented in the child class extends the trait
}
```

### Example 3
***Multiple inheritance from trait***
```diff
trait Vehicle{
  def breaks()= {print("a")}
}

trait Car{
  def breaks()= {print("b")}
}

class Mercedes extends Vehicle with Car {
!  override def breaks(): Unit = super.breaks()      // if same methods present for multiple trait, then the child class extending them must have
                                                     // override...super... statement. And, the trait extended lastly will be executed (Car here).
}

object DemoExample3 {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val car1 = new Mercedes
+   car1.breaks()                                    // The breaks() method from trait Car will be executed here
}
}

+ In multiple inheritance case, Mercedes class inherit the breaks method from the last trait.
```
### Value Class and Universal Traits
***Refer to the example below***
#### <ins> Features of Value Class </ins>
1. Value Class: Cannot allocate runtime object, i.e., when we created object m1 = Mercedes(5) we cannot change
to Mercedes(6) since Value Class has only 1 val parameter which is 5 here, cannot change
2. Value class always has ONLY 1 PARAMETER WITH TYPE AS VAL
3. You cannot extend a Value Class : e.g., class Demo extends MercedesE

#### <ins> Benefits of Value Class </ins>
1. Less initialization
2. Better performance
3. Less Memory usage
4. Use Cases: Performance and Memory Optimization.

```diff
+ // VALUE CLASS CANNOT EXTEND A TRAIT, BUT CAN EXTEND UNIVERSAL TRAIT. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A UNIVERSAL TRAITS
trait CarE extends Any {       // universal trait extends ""Any". "Any" is first level Class (root of Scala class hierarchy)
  def print() {println(this.getClass)}  // "this" will call members(variables/methods) associated with the current object of the class
}
class MercedesE(val x:Int) extends AnyVal with CarE{              //MercedesE is Value Class here
  // var y =1 ---> Cannot define any variables in a value class. Can only define methods
  def hello = {
    println("Hello")
  }
}

object DemoETraits {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val m1 = new MercedesE(5)
    m1.print()
    m1.hello
  }
}
```
